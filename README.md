# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project description

A portfolio website built with node, vue.js as frontend framework and express/sendGrid as backend mailing service. My intent with this project is to build and host my own personal portfolio on my webhotel. This will serve as my online CV and place to showcase other projects and facts about myself.

During the initial face of the project my wife and I used figma to get going with some sort of design. Later on this design changed a bit but the underlying idea is still there. 

Some of the pages planed where removed to make room for links to other media sites, for example my art page on konst.se. It didn't feel neccessary to make my own when there's already another media to cover for art posts etc.
